## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## My name is Ines Pirvan

Iâ€™ve worked on developing and testing of complex systems for EPS (Electric Power Steering), automatic gearbox, autonomous parking and integrating real hardware with virtual environments (Unity).
My professional experience includes:
  - Developing and implementing control algorithms for steering systems and automatic gearboxes.
  - Creating hybrid simulations (hardware and software) to test and validate system behavior.
  - Implementing motion tracking solutions and angle calculation functions to enhance EPS system precision.
  - Working with tools like Jenkins, Tessy, Unity, and AUTOSAR. âœ¨
